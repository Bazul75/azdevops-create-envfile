# 🚀 Generate a `.env` File from an Azure DevOps Variable Group

Easily automate the creation of a `.env` file from an Azure DevOps Variable Group with this custom Azure Pipelines task.

---

## 📚 Overview

This custom task simplifies the management of environment variables by generating a standard `.env` file directly from your Azure DevOps Variable Groups, ensuring consistency and reducing manual errors. Both regular and secret variables defined in the Variable Group will be included in the generated `.env` file.

---

## 🚀 Usage in Azure Pipelines

Make sure the Variable Group is **imported** in your YAML using the `variables` instruction before running this task. For example:

```yaml
variables:
  - group: "YOUR_VARIABLE_GROUP_NAME"
```

Then, add the task to your YAML pipeline as follows:

```yaml
- task: create-env-file@1
  inputs:
    variableGroupName: "YOUR_VARIABLE_GROUP_NAME"
    outputPath: ".env"
```

## 📦 Example Variable Group

Suppose you have a Variable Group named `prueba-env-file` with the following variables:

We will use the next YAML pipeline to reference this variable group and create envfile

The generated `.env` file will look like:

```env
API_KEY="abc123"
DB_HOST="localhost"
```

---

**Parameters:**

- `variableGroupName` (**Required**): Name of the Variable Group to export.
- `outputPath` (**Required**): Path where the `.env` file will be created.

This extension is designed to create the `.env` file including both regular and **secret** values from the Variable Group, making environment variable management in your pipelines easier.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The task executes the following steps:

1. **Reads Inputs**: Accepts the Variable Group name and the desired output path for the `.env` file.
2. **Authenticates**: Uses the system OAuth token to securely access the Azure DevOps REST API.
3. **Fetches Variable Group**: Retrieves the specified Variable Group and its variables.
4. **Generates `.env` File**: Writes the variables to a `.env` file in the specified location.
5. **Reports Outcome**: Marks the task as succeeded or failed based on the operation result.

---

## ✅ Requirements

- The pipeline must have **"Allow scripts to access the OAuth token"** enabled.
- The Variable Group must be linked to the pipeline and contain the required variables.

---

## 📝 Notes

- **Secret variables** are included in the generated `.env`.
- Ensure the Variable Group does not expose confidential information if the `.env` file will be publicly accessible.
- Only plain text variables are supported.
